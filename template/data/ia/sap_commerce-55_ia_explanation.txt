The correct answers are **Option 1: Personalized promotions** and **Option 3: Personalized search results**.  Let's break down why:

**Option 1: Personalized promotions:**  SAP Commerce's customization capabilities allow for highly personalized promotional offers. This goes beyond simply segmenting customers based on basic demographics.  The system can leverage customer data (purchase history, browsing behavior, interaction with marketing campaigns, etc.) to tailor promotions to individual preferences.  This means a customer who frequently buys running shoes might see a promotion for new running socks, while a customer who primarily buys home goods might see a promotion for a new line of kitchen appliances.  This personalization significantly increases the effectiveness of promotional campaigns.

**Option 3: Personalized search results:**  Out-of-the-box, SAP Commerce can customize search results to reflect individual customer preferences and past behaviors.  If a customer frequently searches for organic products, future searches will likely prioritize organic results higher in the ranking.  The system uses algorithms to analyze search history, product views, and purchases to understand individual preferences, then refines search results accordingly. This ensures the most relevant products are presented to each customer, enhancing the shopping experience and driving conversions.

**Why Options 2 and 4 are incorrect:**

* **Option 2: Personalized product bundles:** While SAP Commerce allows for creating product bundles,  *personalizing* these bundles based on individual customer preferences is not a readily available out-of-the-box feature.  While you can configure bundles manually, dynamically creating personalized bundles for each customer requires custom development or leveraging advanced personalization engines beyond the standard Commerce capabilities.

* **Option 4: Personalized prices:**  While some price personalization can be achieved through promotion engines and specific configurations, offering truly individualized pricing (e.g., different prices for the same item based on the customer's perceived willingness to pay) generally requires custom development and integrations with external pricing optimization tools. This is not a standard out-of-the-box feature of Commerce Customizations.


**Practical Example:**

Imagine an online retailer selling clothing.  Using personalized promotions, a customer who has previously purchased several items from the "Casual Wear" category might receive an email promotion offering a 20% discount on new arrivals within that category, or a free gift with purchase.  Simultaneously, the personalized search results feature ensures that when this customer searches for "jeans,"  the results prioritize jeans from the "Casual Wear" category,  and possibly filter out options like formal wear based on their past buying habits.  This combination creates a highly targeted and effective shopping experience.


In summary, while SAP Commerce offers a powerful platform with many customization options,  the focus is on empowering developers to implement solutions.  The core "out-of-the-box" features lean toward personalization strategies that are broadly applicable and manageable without extensive coding, aligning with options 1 and 3.
