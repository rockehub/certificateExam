The correct answers are **Option 1 and Option 3**.

Here's a breakdown explaining why:

* **Option 1: Correct.** Application Management, in the context of the SAP Hybris/SAP Commerce Application Lifecycle Framework (ALF), fundamentally begins after the initial deployment to production.  It's about ensuring the smooth and continuous operation of the live system. This encompasses support, incident management, performance monitoring, and general upkeep.  Think of it as keeping the lights on and the engine running.

* **Option 2: Incorrect.** While smaller development tasks can occur during Application Management (e.g., small bug fixes, minor enhancements), this isn't the primary focus.  Larger developments and new features are typically handled as separate projects within the ALF and then transitioned into Application Management after go-live.  Starting in the initiation phase is incorrect.

* **Option 3: Correct.**  This option accurately captures the essence of Application Management. Supporting, operating, and maintaining the live solution for end-users is the core function. This includes addressing issues, ensuring system stability, and optimizing performance.

* **Option 4: Incorrect.** This describes the *Release Management* process within the ALF, not Application Management. Release Management focuses on the activities required to deploy a new release or version of the application to production. While related, Application Management takes over *after* the go-live event managed by Release Management.


**Practical Example:**

Imagine an online clothing retailer using SAP Commerce.  They've just launched their new website (Go-Live!).  Now, Application Management comes into play.  Here's how:

* **Monitoring:** The Application Management team constantly monitors system performance. They notice that page load times are slow during peak hours.  They investigate and identify a database bottleneck.
* **Incident Management:**  A customer reports they can't complete their checkout process. The Application Management team logs the issue, investigates, identifies a bug in the payment gateway integration, and works with developers to fix and deploy the fix.
* **Support:** The customer service team receives calls about how to use a specific feature on the website. The Application Management team provides documentation and training to the customer service team.
* **Maintenance:** The Application Management team applies security patches and upgrades to the SAP Commerce platform and other integrated systems to keep the platform secure and up-to-date.
* **Small Enhancements:** Based on user feedback, the Application Management team identifies a minor improvement to the product filtering functionality. This small change is developed and deployed quickly, outside of a larger project, as part of ongoing maintenance and improvement.


This example demonstrates how Application Management covers a wide range of activities focused on keeping the live SAP Commerce application running smoothly and efficiently for the end-users after it has gone live. It's the continuous care and feeding of the system to ensure optimal performance, stability, and user satisfaction.
