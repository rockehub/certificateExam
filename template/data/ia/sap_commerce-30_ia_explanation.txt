The correct answers are **3.) Product Detail page**, **4.) Order Form page**, and **5.) Search Results page**.  Let's break down why:

* **3.) Product Detail Page:** This page is the most crucial.  Multidimensional products (e.g., power tools with variations in color, wattage, and voltage) display their attributes and allow users to select specific configurations. Adding attributes directly impacts the display of this configuration selection and the associated information (price, availability, etc.).  The page's layout will need adjustments to accommodate the new attributes, potentially requiring changes to templates, controllers, and the data fetching mechanisms.

* **4.) Order Form Page:** The order form needs to reflect the chosen attributes of the multidimensional product.  It must accurately capture the selected configuration for each item in the order. Adding new attributes means the order form must be updated to include fields for those attributes, ensuring accurate order placement and fulfillment. The form's data binding and validation will need adjustments.

* **5.) Search Results Page:**  If users search for power tools, the search results need to display the relevant attributes.  For instance, if a search filters by "120V" or "red," the search results page must show only products matching that attribute.  Adding new attributes expands the search criteria and necessitates modifications to handle the filtering and display of these new attribute values.  This may involve altering the search index, the search result rendering, and associated back-end logic.


Why the other options are incorrect:

* **1.) Shopping Cart Page:** While the shopping cart displays the selected product configurations, changes to the *number* of attributes don't necessarily require refactoring the cart *page* itself. The cart primarily needs to correctly represent the already selected attributes, handling the added attributes is a matter of data handling, not necessarily UI redesign.  If the attributes impact display (like showing more information in a cart item), minor adjustments might be needed, but a full refactoring is unlikely.

* **2.) Homepage:** The homepage typically showcases promotional offers and categories, but not the granular details of product configurations.  Adding more attributes wouldn't directly impact its design or functionality.


**Practical Example:**

Let's say you sell power drills.  Currently, your multidimensional product has attributes "Color" (Red, Blue) and "Wattage" (500W, 750W).  You add "Battery Type" (Lithium-ion, Nickel-Cadmium) and "Chuck Size" (10mm, 13mm).

* **Product Detail Page:**  The page will now need to display selectors for "Battery Type" and "Chuck Size" in addition to the existing "Color" and "Wattage" options.  The price calculation logic and image display (showing appropriate drill variants) might also need updates.

* **Order Form Page:**  The order form will include new fields for "Battery Type" and "Chuck Size" to capture the customer's selection for each drill added to the order.  Validation rules might need to ensure these fields are populated appropriately.

* **Search Results Page:** The search functionality must be enhanced to allow filtering and sorting by "Battery Type" and "Chuck Size," in addition to the existing criteria. The result display needs to correctly show these attributes for each drill in the results.

The shopping cart would need to represent the added attributes in each drill item, but major UI changes to the cart page itself aren't necessary.  The homepage would remain largely unaffected.  Therefore, the modifications to the other pages concentrate on how the new attributes are displayed, filtered, and processed within the application's workflow.
